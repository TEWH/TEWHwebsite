      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">
        <p>Texas Engineering World Health works on medical projects for the developing world.
            Each year we work on a different project and submit it to the Engineering World Health Competition.
              We work on researching the prevalent problems that need solutions and we look into making the
               idea financially feasible for hospitals in the developing world.  Lastly, we create a
                prototype that encompasses engineering skills from all different engineering fields.
          <br><br>
          In Texas Engineering World Health, members study current global health
          issues and utilize their knowledge and skills to create tangible products
          to address these problems. The main focus of the organization is
          geared towards design project competitions, specifically the Engineering
          World Health Design Competition.</p>

      <p>This year, we are creating a neonatal incubator with bili lights that is
         targeted for the developing world.  Currently, jaundice is a prevalent problem
         in the developing world and without proper treatment, many babies can get
         diagnosed with life threatening diseases.

    Past Project: Freepulse Patient Monitor

        Freepulse Patient Monitor
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">
        <p>FreePulse, a low-cost patient monitor, was the primary project of Texas
          Engineering World Health during the 2014-2015 academic year. Patient monitors
           play a crucial role in virtually all aspects of medical care, including emergency
            and surgical units, intensive and critical care units, and other non-critical units.
             Unfortunately, the cost of current market models ranges from $1,000 to $10,000,
              which has created a low patient-monitor-to-patient ratio in many developing countries.
              <br><br>
              There is a clear and demonstrated need for a low-cost patient monitor that can be purchased in bulk
              by developing world hospitals, thus giving many more patients the monitoring they need. Our project,
              the FreePulse low-cost patient monitor, aims to fill this gap in developing world healthcare and
              provide a durable, reliable, and accessible monitor.
            <br><br>
            FreePulse provides basic monitoring for heart rate, electrocardiogram
            signals (ECG), and percent saturated oxygen (SpO2) with analog and digital
             filtering. Visual alerts are implemented to warn nurses if a patient begins
              to experience cardiac or respiratory distress, matching the capability of
              current market devices. A replaceable backup battery and uninterrupted power
               circuit ensures that the device continues to function even in unstable power
                conditions.
                <br><br>
            This project was the winner of the Engineering World Health design competition
             and was the third place winner in the National Institue of Health's DEBUT competition.
